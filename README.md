## Description
Use this tool to create a team profile consisting of Managers, Engineers, and Interns. The site is responsive and the app comes complete with 17 tests (that all pass -- fingers crossed!).

## Installation
Clone the repo > run ```npm install``` to intialize the included dependencies > run ```node index.js``` to begin taking input.

## Usage
Its a great starting point. Run the intial prompts and then take over manually for further editing!

In terms of what you'll be asked.. we ask for the following input:

1. Employee Type
2. Employee Name
3. Employee Id
4. Employee Email
5. Employee Role

Then, depending on who you choose:
6. Office Number (Manager)
7. GitHub (Engineer)
8. School (Intern)

After some formatting to keep things looking pretty, we will return an ``index.html`` file containing all info that was input.
